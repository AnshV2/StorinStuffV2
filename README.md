# StorinStuffV2

Won't lie I just needed a website to store my logins and stuff. The system I had was incredibly garbage startin to get in my way. Decided I could learn some Svelte while I was at it.
Used Turso as database provider and I gotta say its not bad at all. Definitely will be using for future projects nice and reliable database provider big fan.

Also hosted the whole thing the link should be in the repo but if you can't find it here it is:

Enjoy the free service. Will be updating with some patches at some point.
